Bag-Of-Words Library ToDo's
===========================

* Write bow_barrel_new_from_file(), so we don't get so confused about
  NOT closing the FP.
* Make new versions of structure-file-saving code that take a filename
  and a directory name.  It will be easier to use them.

* Encapsulate the mechanism for looping through documents (with
  words matching a WV).  Ala bow_test_text_wv.

* Rename `bow_cdoc->length' to `bow_cdoc->norm'
* Rename `bow_cdoc->filename' to `bow_cdoc->name'
* Make `bow_cdoc->class' be a vector of floats.
* Rename `bow_wi2dvf_dv()' to `bow_wi2dvf_dv_at_wi()'
* Standardize on use of either `entry' or `entries'.
* Rename all `2' to `_to_'.
* Rename all bow_dv_heap* to bow_dvheap*.
* Rename bow_dv_heap_update() to bow_dvheap_next().


* Split method header information into separate .h files.


Remove rainbow_classnames
Are all filename_to_classname() calls still necessary?
Examine vpc() and fix to take advantage of barrel->classnames.
In rainbow_print_weight_vector() find the class index more efficiently.
Likewise for rainbow_print_foilgain()
Rename bow_free_barrel() to bow_barrel_free...something.
Free heaps in places that they are not!
