* New since version libbow version 0.6.

The library and its front-ends now take GNU-style long-options.  For
example, to see the new rainbow options, execute "./rainbow --help".

NOTE: Several of the options have changed.  For example, `-R' should
be replaced with `-O'.  

WARNING: One of the options as reversed meaning!  Pre-version-0.7,
stemming was on by default; `-S' turned it off; now, stemming is
turned off by default; `-S' will turn it on.

WARNING: The data file format for models have changed.  You will have
to re-build any rainbow or arrow models you created with libbow
version 0.6.  Otherwise rainbow or arrow will crash when reading in
the old models.
